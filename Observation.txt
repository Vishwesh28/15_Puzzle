Observations
Firstly this code helped me alot to understand things. 
I understood fltk very well, to tell my difficulties, there were many difficulties untill I reach the final code 
- Firstly I was unable to change the label of other buttons so I decided to declare buttons as global.
- Then after developing I understood one more thing that I was just swapping but not sliding the buttons so then I used for loop.
- Later one more issue I faced was that I was just labelling the buttons according to their positions but not the movement so for every button I kept kinda house number and whenever the button is moved first I labelled the adjecent button blank and then labelled the earlier blank one with the house number of adjecent and then copied the house number of adjecent to earlier blank one.  
So I learned to how to step by step update the code.
In fltk developing a fully functional game is really great experience and helped me building up my confidence.
Up to now I'm pretty much good regarding topics.
